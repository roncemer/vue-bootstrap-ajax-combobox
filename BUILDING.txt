The kebab-case component name is ajax-combobox.
Take the default for the location to save the files (../ajax-combobox).

    mv ../ajax-combobox/* .
    rmdir ../ajax-combobox

Add the following dependencies to package.json, under the "dependencies" section:

    "vue": ">=2.5.16",
    "axios": ">=0.18.0",
    "font-awesome": ">=4.7.0",
    "bootstrap": ">=4.3.1"

Add the following to build/rollup.config.js, in the "const external" array:

======================================================================
This section discusses building, serving, tagging, committing, pushing
and publishing the component.
======================================================================

Serve the component.  Note: this will serve a broken component because the
CSS and fonts aren't loaded, no props are set by the wrapper, and there is
no server-side API being served.

    vue serve --open ./src/ajax-combobox.vue

Confirm that everything is working.

Update the version number in package.json.

Build the component.

    npm run build

Buid, tag, commit, push and publish a new version of the component.
After updating the version in package.json and building, do the following steps.

Apply git tag, using the version from package.json; commit and push the code.

    git tag <version-from-package.json>
    git commit -a
    git push

Publish the current version to npmjs.com.

    npm publish
